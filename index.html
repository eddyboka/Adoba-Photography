        <h1>Annie Leibovitz</h1>
        <p>
          Annie Leibovitz is an American portrait photographer known for her
          intimate, often dramatic celebrity photographs. Born on October 2,
          1949, in Waterbury, Connecticut, she began her career as a staff
          photographer for Rolling Stone magazine in 1970. Her distinctive style
          of capturing celebrities in unusual, artistic poses quickly gained
          attention. Leibovitz is particularly known for her work with
          high-profile figures such as John Lennon, who posed for her hours
          before his death in 1980, and her iconic portraits of Queen Elizabeth
          II, as well as her contributions to Vanity Fair and Vogue. Over the
          years, her work has helped shape the visual culture of modern
          celebrity and has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the
          world.

        <h1>Devin Allen</h1>
        <p>
          Devin Allen is a renowned American photographer and activist, best
          known for his powerful images documenting the Black experience in the
          United States, particularly in the context of social justice
          movements. He gained significant attention for his photography of the
          2015 Baltimore protests following the death of Freddie Gray, with his
          work capturing both the intensity and the resilience of the moment.
          Allen's photos have appeared in major publications like Time, The New
          York Times, and National Geographic. His work focuses on issues like
          race, identity, and the struggles faced by marginalized communities.
          Beyond photography, Allen is an advocate for social change, using his
          platform to amplify voices and bring attention to systemic issues.

        <h1>A Show of Photography Class</h1>
        <p>
          Photography is the art and practice of capturing images using a
          camera, typically by recording light onto a photosensitive surface
          such as film or a digital sensor. It involves framing scenes,
          adjusting settings (like exposure and focus), and often editing the
          photos to enhance their visual appeal. Photography can serve various
          purposes, such as artistic expression, documentation, storytelling,
          and communication.
